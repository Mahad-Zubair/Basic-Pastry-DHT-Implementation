## Welcome to the Pastry Network Playground! 🥐

### Overview
This Python script simulates a Pastry network, a distributed hash table for routing in peer-to-peer systems. Nodes join, update, and interact within the network, showcasing the power of decentralized communication.

### Features
- **Node Creation**: Dynamically create nodes in the network.
- **Node Deletion**: Remove nodes from the Pastry network.
- **Data Distribution**: Add elements to nodes for storage and retrieval.
- **Node Details**: View detailed information about specific nodes.
- **Lookup Queries**: Perform routing and lookup operations within the network.

### Getting Started
1. Run the script and enter the number of nodes to create.
2. Explore options:
   - **Exit**: Quit the program.
   - **Delete Nodes**: Remove nodes from the network.
   - **Add Elements**: Distribute elements among nodes.
   - **Print Node Details**: View node-specific information.
   - **Lookup Queries**: Perform routing and lookup operations.

### Let's Play with Pastry! 🎉
- Create nodes, distribute data, and watch the network evolve.
- Experiment with node deletion and observe network restructuring.
- Dive into routing queries to explore efficient data retrieval.

### Have Fun Exploring the Pastry Network! 🚀

Feel free to customize, experiment, and enjoy the world of decentralized communication with Pastry! 🌐🥐
